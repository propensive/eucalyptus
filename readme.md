# Eucalyptus

__Versatile logging__

_Eucalyptus_ is a logging library which makes it easy to add logging to any project. It consciously
makes logging configuration explicit and easily understood, and uses rich ANSI-escaped messages to
make logs easier to read.

## Features

- logging requires explicit configuration in code, avoiding any doubt about whether or where logs are produced
- logging "realms" are defined as givens
- logging configuration may be static or delegate to dynamic criteria
- unlogged messages are not evaluated, avoiding the cost of construction
- simple definitions for the log format
- log messages may contains text styles and color, using ANSI codes; this helps readability
- typeclass-based support for logging different types of object


## Availability

Eucalyptus has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

### Defining a logger

Libraries which use Eucalyptus for logging will need a contextual `Log` instance before they can
be used. This may be as simple as defining a `given Log()` instance in the package where the
libraries are used:
```scala
given Log()
```

This will construct the simplest possible `Log` which logs nothing.

A better alternative may be a logger which logs everything to `STDOUT`,
```scala
given Log(Everything |-> Stdout)
```
or which logs everything at `Warn` level or hight to `STDOUT`:
```scala
given Log(Everything.warn |-> Stdout)
```

### Library Code

#### Contextual `Log` instances

Any method which requires logging should request a contextual `Log` parameter. This
is as simple as adding the parameter block, `(using Log)` to the method. Any methods
which call such a method will also need to include a `using Log` parameter.

#### Log messages

Messages may be logged (at a particular level) by calling one of four methods,
- `Log.fine`
- `Log.info`
- `Log.warn`
- `Log.fail`
passing the single parameter of an `AnsiText` containing the message to be logged.

These methods each take a single parameter which is typically an `AnsiText` or a
`Text`, but can be any type that has a given `AnsiShow` instance available.

#### Realm

These four methods require a contextual `Realm` instance. Conventionally, this would 
be declared in the main application package, and called `realm`, like so,
```scala
package mylibrary
given realm: Realm = Realm("mylibrary")
```
where `mylibrary` is the name that will appear in the logs. The name `realm` is given
explicitly so that a user-defined `Log` instance may be configured to reference this
realm within the package `mylibrary`, for example:
```scala
Log(mylibrary.realm |-> Stdout)
```

Since `given` instances are not imported by default with a wildcard import, a `Realm`
definition does not need to be marked as private.

### Configuration

When working with libraries such as [Scintillate](https://github.com/propensive/scintillate) or
[Guillotine](https://github.com/propensive/guillotine), whose methods require
a `Log` instance, it is possible to selectively include logs from specific libraries,
by referring to that library's realm instead of `Everything`, for example:
```scala
given Log(scintillate.realm |-> Stdout)
```
As with `Everything`, a level may also be specified:
```scala
given Log(scintillate.realm.warn |-> Stdout)
```

And multiple rules may be included as repeated arguments to the `Log` constructor, for example:
```scala
given Log(
  scintillate.realm.info |-> Stdout,
  guillotine.realm       |-> Stdout,
  probably.realm.fail    |-> Stdout
)
```



## Status

Eucalyptus is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Eucalyptus is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 239 lines of code.

## Building

Eucalyptus can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Eucalyptus are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/eucalyptus/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Eucalyptus easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

Eucalyptus was designed and developed by Jon Pretty, and commercial support and training is available from

## Name

The _Eucalyptus_ tree is flexible and good for logging.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
